## A solution concept for predicting non-Nash equilibrium probabilities of possible outcomes in strategic games

**Abstract**: ‎In conventional game theory it is assumed that each player is perfectly rational‎, ‎enabling her to choose the optimal probability distribution over her possible strategies‎. ‎In a realistic situation‎, ‎however‎, ‎players are rarely perfectly rational‎, ‎e.g.‎, ‎due to noise in the environment, information-processing costs, or innate, psychological features of the subjects‎. ‎This bounded rationality is the main reason why the Nash equilibrium predictions of normative game theory often do not align with the results of real experiments‎. ‎Therefore‎, ‎developing frameworks inspired by non-Nash equilibrium concepts is vital to model bounded rationality‎. ‎Here‎, ‎we present a novel solution concept based on the Boltzmann weight to predict the non-Nash equilibrium probabilities of possible outcomes in two-person strategic games where each player has two possible strategies‎. ‎We argue that the concept of bounded rationality can be parameterized by assigning a temperature to each player‎, ‎mimicking their sanity‎. ‎Temperature variations allow the players to interpolate between two qualitatively different regimes of choices‎, ‎i.e.‎, ‎utility maximization (perfectly rational players at zero temperature) and equiprobable choices (perfectly irrational players at infinite temperature)‎. ‎Whether the players employ pure or mixed strategies‎, ‎given the probabilities of players over their strategies our framework can determine the temperature of the players‎. ‎Alternatively‎, ‎when the players' temperatures are given it would be possible to predict the non-Nash equilibrium probabilities of each player over her strategies‎, ‎depending on the difference between the expected payoffs of each set of probabilities rather than the corresponding utilities‎. ‎Our approach reinterprets the concept of temperature in games in a more generic manner and offers a solution concept for predicting non-Nash equilibrium probabilities which may leverage the development of theory-based frameworks to bridge the predictions of normative game theory and the results of behavioral experiments‎.
