## A theoretical framework to explain non-Nash equilibrium strategic behavior in experimental games

**Abstract**: ‎‎In conventional game theory‎, ‎it is assumed that players are perfectly rational‎, ‎enabling them to choose the optimal probability distribution over their strategies‎. ‎In a realistic situation‎, ‎however‎, ‎players are rarely perfectly rational‎. ‎This bounded rationality is one of the main reasons why the predictions of Nash equilibrium in normative game theory often diverge from human behavior in real experiments‎. ‎Therefore‎, ‎it is essential to develop frameworks inspired by non-Nash equilibrium concepts to better model bounded rationality‎. ‎Motivated by the Boltzmann weight formalism‎, ‎here‎ ‎we present a theoretical framework to predict the non-Nash equilibrium probabilities of possible outcomes in two-person strategic games by focusing on the differences in expected payoffs of players rather than traditional utility metrics‎. ‎More specifically‎, ‎in this model‏‎ ‎bounded rationality is parameterized by assigning a temperature to each player‎, ‎reflecting their level of rationality‎. ‎Temperature variations allow the players to interpolate between two different decision-making regimes‎, ‎i.e.‎, ‎utility maximization (representing decisions made by perfectly rational players at zero temperature) and equiprobable choices (representing decisions made by perfectly irrational players at infinite temperature)‎. ‎Whether players employ pure or mixed strategies‎, ‎our framework provides a full description over all possible joint strategies and is able to determine the relative probabilities for different choices as well as for multiple pure or mixed strategy Nash equilibria‎. ‎To validate model predictions‎, ‎by analyzing experimental data we demonstrated that our model can successfully explain non-Nash equilibrium strategic behavior in the experimental Dictator game and Ultimatum game‎. ‎Our results show that the distributions of offers predicted by the model are in good agreement with the experimentally observed offers in each game‎. This approach reinterprets the concept of temperature in game theory in a more generic manner and offers a solution concept for predicting non-Nash equilibrium strategic behavior‎, ‎leveraging the development of theoretical frameworks to bridge the gap between the predictions of normative game theory and the results of behavioral experiments.
